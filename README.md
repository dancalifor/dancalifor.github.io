Project: Landing Page
I'm going to do a landing page that contains random stuff, maybe some friends could be a part from my page, just to show them how great it's The Odin Project, yeah baby, Internet it's "JARYI LOCO"

Look mom, i'm becoming a web developer *proceeds to fall to the ground*


- Ideas:
    .Page that talk about of my friends from university, just in a funny way
    .LuDa front page, it was an idea of Lucas, but just i want to put that name because it's a very creative company name
    .This page will be just for funny ideas but in the way i have to change everything to be more serious
    .added photos of friends of my university just to show them
    .added just the default template showed on the course but with some ideas
- Issues/troubles:
    Time and motivation but have to be enough strong with my coding skills, for now just html and css
- To fix and fixed:
    Just learned about border-radius for images and i don't know if it's necessary to use so much div's
    fixed the text that overflow the div and equal the size with max-width with the text boxes
    fixed margin and padding values for every card that uses
    had to fix the random information i guess putting it all in a row
    fix the uses of div but in a future
