Project: Landing Page
I'm going to do a landing page that contains random stuff, maybe some friends could be a part from my page, just to show them how great it's The Odin Project, yeah baby, Internet it's "JARYI LOCO"

Look mom, i'm becoming a web developer *proceeds to fall to the ground*


- Ideas:
    .Page that talk about of my friends from university, just in a funny way
    .LuDa frontpage, it was an idea of Lucas, but just i want to put that name because it's a very creative company name
    .This page will be just for funny ideas but in the way i have to change everything to be more serious
- Issues/troubles:
    Time and motivation but have to be enough strong with my coding skills, for now just html and css
- To fix and fixed:
    Just learned about border-radius for images and i dont know if it's necessary to use so much divs
